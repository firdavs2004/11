            <p>Woven Issue Four </p>
            <h6>Issue 4 explores the paradoxes at play in our world: death and rebirth, old and new, past and future. We take on a mindset of endless growth and the many catalysts we encounter in the creative process: setbacks, loss, imagination, and serendipity. From poetry to plants, this issue looks intently into the face of the immeasurable forces that propel us forward, and meditates on our role in designing the future.</h6>
